<h1>This project is entitled "Creating a Message Board".</h1>
<br />
<p>We used django to create posts for a message board, as well as the other functions associated with posting, such as edits and deletions.  We had different views for the posts such as detailed (a single post)and a list feature (displaying multiple posts at one time). Jinja 2 is the template engine and we used inheritance from parent to 
child to extend the model class.  Learning the terminal command prompts and sequencing the correct order of things was stressed.</p>
